# Music Reactive LedStrip 

<br>

# Overview 

<br>

- Thanks to the MSGEQ7 chip which applies the FFT (fast fourier transform) formula , i was able to convert the different sound frequencies (bass, mids , treble) coming from a music track to a digital signal visualized through a LED strip Resulting in lights dancing to different music frequencies in sync .

- gained knowledge on :
    - FFT
    - MSGEQ7 (Within Spectrum Shield breakout board)
    - WS1128B (Ledstrip)
